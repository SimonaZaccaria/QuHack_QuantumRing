Documentation for the Quantum Factorization Code
This code implements Shor's Algorithm for integer factorization using Qiskit and QuantumRingsLib, combined with a SAT solver (python-sat) to optimize the process. The goal is to factorize semiprime numbers from the smallest to the largest bit-length possible, leveraging quantum computing for efficiency.

Libraries and Dependencies
The code imports several essential libraries:

Qiskit: For quantum circuit simulation and execution.
QuantumRingsLib: A quantum computing backend provider.
pysat.solvers (Glucose3): A SAT solver to find integer factors.
Sympy: For computing greatest common divisors (GCD).
Matplotlib: For visualizing results.

Quantum Rings Provider Setup
The QuantumRingsProvider is initialized with a token and an email address to access the "scarlet_quantum_rings" backend. This backend is used for executing quantum circuits.

Semiprime Numbers Dataset
A dictionary named semiprimes is defined, containing semiprime numbers of increasing bit lengths. These numbers serve as test cases for the algorithm.

Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) Inverse Function
The function qft_dagger(qc, n) implements the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) on a quantum circuit:
1 - Swaps qubits to reverse order.
2 - Applies controlled phase gates (CP) and Hadamard gates (H).

SAT Solver for Factorization
The function solve_factors(N) uses a brute-force approach to find two factors of N by iterating up to its square root. If p * q = N is found, it returns (p, q).

Implementation of Shorâ€™s Algorithm

The function shors_algorithm(N) performs the factorization:

1 - Handles trivial cases: If N is even, returns (2, N/2).
2 - Selects a random integer a coprime with N using the GCD function.
3 - Builds a quantum circuit:
    Creates a Hadamard transform on a register.
    Implements a simplified modular exponentiation step.
    Applies inverse QFT and performs measurements.
4 - Executes the quantum circuit on the QuantumRings backend.
5 - Extracts measurement results and processes them using the SAT solver.
6 - Checks for valid factors and prints them.

Execution Loop
The script iterates through all the semiprime numbers from smallest to largest, running shors_algorithm(N) for each and printing the results.

Example Output
The output displays the factorization process for each number, including:

The selected random number a.
The factors found.
Whether the factorization was successful.
